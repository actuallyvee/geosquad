# Geosquad
A mobile application in the process of development in Fall 2024, the Geosquad mobile app is designed to effectively and effortlessly create a streamlined system for those in areas affected by natural disasters and war zones. It provides users with the ability to find safe passages, medical aid, water relief, and locate loved ones. The application includes features such as the ability to mark "I am safe," pinpoint various locations using icons, and create a 'circle' of people to check in on.
